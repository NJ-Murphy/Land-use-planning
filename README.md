# land-use-planning

The aim of this project is to explore various optimization techniques in order to optimally allocate a set of 9 pre-specified land-use types to a 400ha region subject to mutiple objectives and constraints. The idea is to develop the brackish peat meadow which is criss-crossed by water and populated by vast amounts of vegetation and bird life as part of a nature and recreation development plan. As part of the development plan, three additive objectives were identified to transform the current region subject to constraints such as the total amount of land allocated to each of the land-use types and to certain areas of land in the region which cannot be converted from their current uses. 

Two optimzation methods are compared for single objective optimization: Linear programming and a Genetic Algorithm

I then use Archimedean Goal Programming to optimize all three objectives simultaneously.
